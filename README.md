## What It Is

Calabash is a local-first case-file board for tracking characters, aliases, clues, relationships, and theories while you read. It is named after Sherlock Holmes' calabash pipe: the tool does not solve the case for you, but it sits beside you while you think.

Use it as a mystery reading notes app, detective fiction relationship graph, clue tracker, or private case board for long novels, fair-play mysteries, manga cases, and puzzle competitions.

The current public demo runs entirely in the browser. There is no account system, no hosted reader database, and no server-side save file.

## No AI, By Design

Detective novels are not puzzles to outsource. They are puzzles to inhabit.

Calabash is deliberately manual. No AI extraction, no summaries, no automatic suspect ranking. Every character you add is someone you chose to notice; every relationship you draw is a hypothesis you are willing to test; every edge you change from suspected to confirmed is a small victory of attention.

## Highlights

- **Chapter slider**: move through the book and only see what you knew at that chapter.
- **Spoiler Shield**: cover reveal-heavy chapters until you choose to uncover them.
- **Character board**: track portraits, aliases, roles, occupations, introductions, and notes.
- **Board styles**: switch between compact text cards and large portrait case-file cards.
- **Relationship certainty**: mark connections as confirmed, suspected, or disproven.
- **Open text fields**: roles and relationship types are suggestions, not hard limits.
- **Sticky notes and groups**: keep clues near the board and draw colored group regions behind characters.
- **Starter imports**: start a new book from a single-book JSON file, including an LLM-friendly template.
- **Local library**: save books in IndexedDB and back them up with Export/Import.
- **Built-in tutorials**: try *The Murder of Roger Ackroyd* or *Hida Trick House Murder Case*.
- **Multilingual UI**: English, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, and Brazilian Portuguese.
- **Desktop beta**: `v0.2.2` ships unsigned Windows/Linux binaries and macOS DMG images, with an in-app release checker.

## Data And Privacy

Calabash is local-first:

- Your books are stored in your browser with IndexedDB.
- Theme, language, and onboarding preferences use localStorage.
- Other demo visitors cannot change your board, and you cannot change theirs.
- Clearing browser site data can delete your local library during beta.
- Use **Export Library** as your backup path and **Import Library** to move data to another browser.

## Quick Start

1. Open the [live demo](https://guesswhat-studio.github.io/Calabash/).
2. Choose the Ackroyd tutorial, the Kindaichi tutorial, or a blank book.
3. Press `N` to add a character.
4. Select a character, press `E`, then click another character to add a relationship.
5. Move the chapter slider as you read.
6. Export your library when you want a backup.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `N` | New character |
| `E` | Connect edge from selected character |
| `F` | Fit board to view |
| `/` | Search |
| `Delete` / `Backspace` | Delete selected item |
| `Ctrl/Cmd + Z` | Undo |
| `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Z` | Redo |

## Who It Is For

Calabash is for readers who enjoy doing the detective work themselves:

- Classic mystery readers: Agatha Christie, Ellery Queen, John Dickson Carr, S. S. Van Dine.
- Manga and TV mystery fans tracking aliases, masked identities, and late reveals.
- Mystery puzzle and contest solvers who need a temporary case board for people, clues, locations, and hypotheses.
- Readers of character-dense fiction: fantasy, historical novels, family sagas, political thrillers.
- Anyone who wants a quiet, private, no-account tool for thinking with a story.

Calabash is not a book tracker, ebook reader, writing tool, AI summarizer, or social platform.

## Development

The app lives in `app/` and runs as a Vite React project.

```bash
cd app
npm install
npm run dev       # http://localhost:5173
npm run typecheck # TypeScript check
npm test          # Vitest suite
npm run build     # production build
```

GitHub Pages build:

```bash
cd app
VITE_BASE_PATH=/Calabash/ npm run build
```

Desktop shell:

```bash
npm install
npm run desktop:dev
npm run desktop:build
```

Desktop builds require Rust and use the Tauri 2 shell in `src-tauri/`. The React app remains the single frontend for both web and desktop.

Release builds:

- Every public version should have an annotated `vX.Y.Z` tag and a GitHub Release.
- Pushing a `v*` tag runs the release workflow and uploads the web bundle.
- Starting with the `0.2` desktop shell, the same workflow also uploads unsigned plain Windows, Linux, and macOS desktop binaries.

Optional local tutorial portraits:

```bash
cd app
npm run fetch:kindaichi-portraits
```

The public demo includes the Kindaichi tutorial portraits in `app/public/demo-portraits/`. The Ackroyd tutorial uses original generated case-file avatars.

## Roadmap

The product roadmap is intentionally not kept in the public repository. Public planning should live in [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/orgs/Guesswhat-Studio/projects); GitHub Issues are open for bugs, beta feedback, and feature proposals.

## Versioning

Calabash uses `0.x` beta versioning for now:

- `0.1.0`: first public web demo.
- `0.1.1`: public-facing repository cleanup, multilingual README split, issue templates, and beta docs polish.
- `0.1.2`: inspector localization polish and simplified character details panel.
- `0.1.3`: beta-readiness storage warnings, import/export fixture regression coverage, and release validation.
- `0.2.0`: desktop shell, cross-platform binary release setup, onboarding language selection, chapter-aware notes/groups, relationship rendering fixes, and adjustable board annotations.
- `0.2.1`: active update checks from Settings and single-book JSON imports for faster case setup.
